# Quizzer
Quizzer is a web application that can be used to play pub quizzes or trivia nights. It was created by two HAN students as part of the final assessment for the course DWA in the second year of their IT study.

## SPA's
Quizzer contains three Single Page Applications(SPA's):
 - The team app for the participants of Quizzer
 - The quizz master app for the quizz master who hosts Quizzer
 - The score board app which displays the score for each team on a big screen

## Technical
Quizzer uses MongoDB, Express, React (with Redux) and Node (MERN stack), supplemented with the WebSocket protocol.

There are four different apps: the server, the quizmaster app, the teams app and the scoreboard app.

The [docs](/docs) folder contains a *Software Guidebook â€“ lite*, with wireframes with react components, interactions, REST api, WebSocket specification and a whole lot more.
